For this run, I saw that the model was learning at a steady rate but did not reach its full potential, around 1.58 total loss, due to the number of epochs I set. As such, I kept the rate the same and increased the epochs to 25. \n",

    "For the third run, I tried a rate of 0.2 and had 25 epochs. This time, I noticed that the model was able to get a loss of 0.8568 which was better than the previous run but still could be improved upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the fourth run, I tried the same learning rate of 0.2 but increased the number of epochs to 50 and got a loss of 0.6082. Though this was the best run I got, I decided to try a greater learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the fifth run, I used a learning rate of 0.25 and 50 epochs and had a loss of 0.6081. Again, this was better than the previous attempt, but I noticed that every other epoch would cause the loss to jump up then decrease for the next epoch after it. As such, I determined that a learning rate greater than this wouldn't be a good idea. As a result, I tried experimenting with learing rates between 0.2 - 0.25 and saw that a learning rate of 0.2 was optimal since it never showed that rebounding behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my next significant attempt, I wanted to increase the number of epochs to see how low the loss could go, so I used a learning rate of 0.2 and 100 epochs. I was able to obtain a loss of 0.4786 but wanted to see how far I could train the model before I overfitted. So, I began testing greater and greater epochs and used the testing data to verify that I was doing good.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process, I was finally able to land on a loss of 0.4328 by using a learning rate of 0.2 and 150 epochs. Anything above 150 epochs would keep the loss at a range between 0.43 - 0.44."
